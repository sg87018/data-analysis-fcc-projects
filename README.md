# Data Analysis with Python

The Purpose of this repository is to showcase the skills I've gained from the FreeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification. These include reading data from sources such as CSV's, using libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to clean and visualize data, and gaining fundamental knowledge of using Jupyter Notebooks.
